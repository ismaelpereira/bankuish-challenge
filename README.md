# Bankuish Challenge

## Running with docker

This is my resolution for bankuish challenge, to run you need to run `

`docker-compose up`

But before, you need to configure your project in firebase. You can see the tutorial [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?hl=en-us) and create a Database in Docker if not created

## Running locally

You need to run

`npm install`

Then, you need to configure your project in firebase. You can see the tutorial [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?hl=en-us) and create a SQL Database and check the config on `./db/config.ts`
